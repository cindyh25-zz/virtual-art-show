    <h2>About the Show</h2>

    <p>Due to the current pandemic, we can no longer show students' artwork in person. However, we still would like to admire their beautiful work!</p>
    <p>Thus, this year's art show will be hosted virtually. You can view the pieces students submitted and filter to view work from certain classes and with different mediums of art. Enjoy!</p>
